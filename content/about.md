AS51019 is the autonomous system representing a research network operated from ReykjavÃ­k, the capital of Iceland.

Research is the primary purpose of AS51019, the intention is to learn while being a small part of the global internet. This means most traffic to and from AS51019 is rooted, one way or another, in research. This can be big or small.

AS51019 is not a "backbone" and does not have one. Any traffic carried directly between points of presence is encapsulated. It is acknowledged that encapsulation in scenarios like these does degrade performance, but, performance is not the goal. Any encapsulation is only done for research/experiments where simulated point-to-point links are required/beneficial.

If you are here because you are receiving or have received either harmful or suspicious looking traffic from AS51019, contact [abuse@as51019.com](mailto:abuse@as51019.com), your case will be reviewed thoroughly and happily resolved ðŸ˜º
